# IW AI Core — CLAUDE.md

AI orchestration platform that drives AI-assisted development across multiple projects: schedules LLM agents in git worktrees, aggregates background jobs, and surfaces a web UI for code understanding, docs, research, tests, and batch control.

## Architecture

A single **daemon** polls PostgreSQL (port 5433) every 60s, picks approved batches across registered projects, creates git worktrees, launches LLM agents (opencode or claude-code), runs fix cycles, and squash-merges to main. The daemon also polls `DocGenerationJob` (AI doc regen) and `CodeIndexJob` (LanceDB indexing).

The **FastAPI dashboard** (port 9900) is the human interface. Per-project pages include:
- **Queue / History / Batches** — design and run work items
- **Code** — RAG-backed module browsing, symbol explainer, streaming Q&A with citations (`orch/rag/`)
- **Docs** — project doc catalogue with versioning, HTML/PDF exports, stale detection, and diffs; a global `/docs` route spans all projects
- **Research** — curated research documents (doc_type=research)
- **Tests / Quality** — launch and monitor test suites and quality gates from the UI (`orch/test_runner.py`)
- **Jobs** — unified table of background jobs (batches, code index, doc generation, research drafts)
- **Worktrees** — git status of all active agent worktrees

The **`iw` CLI** is the agent-to-DB bridge — agents call `iw step-done` to record results. All operational state lives in PostgreSQL — no files, no race conditions.

## Critical Rules

- **NEVER** connect tests to live DB (port 5433) — use testcontainers only (see `tests/CLAUDE.md`)
- **NEVER** call `importlib.reload(orch.config)` in tests — use `monkeypatch.delenv()` instead
- **NEVER** mock the database in integration tests — FOR UPDATE locking can't be tested otherwise
- **MUST** replace psycopg2 URLs in testcontainers: `url.replace("postgresql+psycopg2://", "postgresql+psycopg://")`
- **MUST** run `FTS_FUNCTION_SQL` + `FTS_TRIGGER_SQL` after `Base.metadata.create_all()` in tests
- **CRITICAL**: `DaemonEvent.metadata` is named `event_metadata` in Python — SQLAlchemy reserves `metadata`
- **MUST** ensure `.env` and `.iw/` are listed in every managed project's `.gitignore` — daemon refuses to launch worktrees otherwise.
- **NEW**: per-worktree DB exists for app runtime when project has `ai-dev/iw-config/`. The agent's `IW_CORE_DB_*` env vars point at the per-worktree DB; `IW_CORE_ORCH_DB_*` always points at the global orch DB on 5433.
- **NEVER** apply an uncommitted Alembic migration to the production orch DB. Every worktree is `git worktree add`-ed from a commit, while its per-worktree DB is `pg_dump`-restored from prod — so a revision file that's in your working tree but not committed will be missing in worktrees while their DB is already at that revision, and `alembic upgrade head` dies with `Can't locate revision identified by '<rev>'`, taking down the worktree's E2E compose stack. Commit the revision file (or `alembic downgrade` and remove it) before doing anything else. (Diagnosed in I-00075 / I-00076.)
- **MUST** generate new Alembic migrations with `make migration-pending MSG="describe change"` rather than calling `alembic revision --autogenerate` directly. This writes `down_revision = "PENDING"` into the generated file; `migration_rebase.py` resolves it to the real chain head at merge time. See CR-00091.
- **MUST** update `_HEAD_REVISION` constants and catalog count constants in test files whenever a new migration is merged to main. Search for `_HEAD_REVISION` and for integer literals in test assertions that count runtime options or migration steps — these must reflect the new head after every merge. Failure to update them breaks every in-flight worktree simultaneously (CR-00095, Issue E).
- **MUST** keep Jinja2 `format`-filter calls `%`-style: `"%dm%02ds"|format(m, s)`, never `str.format`-style `"{}m{}s"|format(m, s)` (raises `TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting` at render time — and only when real data exercises the branch). Enforced by `make lint` → `scripts/check_templates.py`. (See I-00075.)
- **NEVER** use `agent-browser` for browser automation — use `playwright-cli` exclusively
- **NEVER** run `npx playwright install` or modify `.playwright/cli.config.json`
- **NEVER** run `docker compose up` (with or without `-d db`) against the orchestration DB from any directory — the default compose file is empty and the bootstrap file requires an explicit `-f` flag. Use `./ai-core.sh db start` instead. See `docs/IW_AI_Core_DB_Setup.md`.
- **NEVER** read, write, move, or delete anything under the backup directory (`IW_CORE_BACKUP_DIR`, default `/opt/postgres/data/backups`). Backup sets contain a `globals.sql` file with **role password hashes** (written `0600` inside a `0700` set directory); agents MUST NOT touch backup sets, copy them, or paste their contents into logs/reports/issues. Backups are created and pruned only by the daemon poller and the `iw db-backup` CLI. See `docs/IW_AI_Core_DB_Backup_Restore.md`.
- **MUST** append plain CSS rules directly to `dashboard/static/styles.css` when `make css` reports "Nothing to be done" or the Tailwind CLI fails (e.g., missing `postcss-selector-parser`) — plain CSS is served as-is, so no Tailwind recompile is required. Temporary mitigation until the Tailwind toolchain is repaired in worktrees (see I-00067).
- **MUST** invoke the `/iw-research` skill whenever the user asks for "a research", "online research", "deep research", "investigate X", "research X", or any equivalent phrasing — even when the agent believes it could answer inline. The user's expectation is that a research artifact is **filed in the IW AI Core database** so they can review it on the dashboard. **NEVER** silently perform inline web research as a substitute for `/iw-research`. The only acceptable exception is `/iw-research-quick`, and it may only be used when the user **explicitly** writes "quick research" / `/iw-research-quick` or asks a single trivial fact lookup that they have explicitly said should not be filed. When in doubt, default to `/iw-research`.

## Code Comments

All Python code **MUST** use **Google-style docstrings**. Missing or incomplete docstrings are a MEDIUM-severity code review finding (HIGH for any public-facing API surface). Generated code that omits docstrings is a quality failure caught at review time.

### Required Coverage

| Element | Required |
|---------|----------|
| Module | One-line summary + description of what the module provides |
| Class | One-line summary; `Attributes:` section for significant public state |
| Public function / method | One-line summary + `Args:`, `Returns:`, `Raises:` as applicable |
| Private function / method (`_name`) | Docstring when logic is non-trivial; otherwise skip |
| Inline `#` comment | Non-obvious *why*, hidden constraints, subtle invariants, external workarounds |

### Google-Style Format

```python
"""Module summary line.

Longer description of what the module provides and its main responsibilities.
"""


class MyService:
    """Manages the lifecycle of background workers.

    Attributes:
        max_workers: Maximum number of concurrent workers allowed.
        timeout_secs: Per-worker idle timeout in seconds.
    """

    def process_batch(self, items: list[Item], dry_run: bool = False) -> BatchResult:
        """Process a batch of items, optionally without writing to the DB.

        Iterates items in dependency order and applies the registered handler
        for each item type. Failed items are recorded but do not abort the batch.

        Args:
            items: Items to process — dependency sort applied internally.
            dry_run: When True, handlers run but DB writes are skipped.

        Returns:
            BatchResult with counts for succeeded, failed, and skipped items.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If items contains duplicate IDs.
        """
```

### Test File Rules

Test files follow the same standard with one difference: `test_*` functions only need a **one-line scenario description** — no `Args:`, `Returns:`, or `Raises:` sections. The purpose is to describe the *scenario* being verified, not re-state the assertion.

| Element | Required |
|---------|----------|
| Test module | One-line summary describing what behaviors the file covers |
| Test class (`TestFoo`) | One-line summary describing the group of scenarios |
| `test_*` function | **One-line only** — describe the scenario, not the mechanics: `"Verifies that step advancement is blocked when the migration lock is held."` |
| Fixture / helper (non-`test_`) | Full docstring with `Args:`/`Returns:` as applicable |

```python
"""Tests for the batch manager's state-machine transitions."""


class TestBatchLifecycle:
    """Covers approved → running → complete/failed paths."""

    def test_batch_moves_to_running_when_approved(self, db_session):
        """Verifies that an approved batch transitions to running on the next daemon poll."""
```

### Rules

- **NEVER** write `# This function does X` — the function name already says that.
- **NEVER** use multi-paragraph inline comment blocks — one short line max.
- **DO** include `Args:`, `Returns:`, and `Raises:` for any function with parameters, a non-`None` return, or documented exceptions. Omit sections that don't apply.
- **DO NOT** repeat type-hint information in `Args:` — types live in the signature.
- Docstrings go immediately after the `def`/`class` line, not before it.

## Research Requests

Two skills exist; pick correctly:

| User phrasing | Skill |
|---------------|-------|
| "do a research", "research X", "deep research", "investigate", "evaluate options", "/iw-research" | `/iw-research` (files a Research doc, allocates `R-NNNNN`, registers in DB) |
| "quick research", "/iw-research-quick", a single explicit one-liner the user said should NOT be filed | `/iw-research-quick` (inline answer, no file, no ID) |

The default for this project is `/iw-research`. Do not downgrade to `/iw-research-quick` because the topic seems small — only the user can authorize that downgrade by using "quick" or `/iw-research-quick` explicitly.

## Configuration

All config in `.env` (gitignored). **NEVER** hardcode ports, URLs, or credentials.
Key vars: `IW_CORE_DB_HOST`, `IW_CORE_DB_PORT` (5433), `IW_CORE_DB_NAME`, `IW_CORE_DB_USER`, `IW_CORE_DB_PASSWORD`, `IW_CORE_DASHBOARD_PORT` (9900), `IW_CORE_POLL_INTERVAL`, `IW_CORE_STALL_THRESHOLD`, `IW_CORE_EXPECTED_INSTANCE_ID` (DB identity pin — see `orch/db/identity.py`).

**Database backups (F-00092)** — the daemon takes daily logical backups and operators can take on-demand ones via `iw db-backup` / `./ai-core.sh db backup`. Config vars:
- `IW_CORE_BACKUP_ENABLED` (default `true`) — disables the *scheduled* backup poller when false; `iw db-backup create` still works as a manual override.
- `IW_CORE_BACKUP_DIR` (default `/opt/postgres/data/backups`) — where backup sets are written.
- `IW_CORE_BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` (default `30`) — scheduled backups strictly older than this are pruned; manual/labeled backups are never pruned.
- `IW_CORE_BACKUP_TIME` (default `03:00`) — daily scheduled-backup time (HH:MM); the poller does missed-window catch-up after daemon downtime.
- `IW_CORE_BACKUP_DB_USER` / `IW_CORE_BACKUP_DB_PASSWORD` (default unset) — optional **superuser** credentials used **only** for the `pg_dumpall --globals-only` step, which reads role password hashes from `pg_authid` (superuser-only). When unset, the globals dump falls back to the app role (`IW_CORE_DB_USER`); if that role is not a superuser, the globals dump fails with `permission denied for table pg_authid`. Set these to a superuser (e.g. `postgres`) to capture role globals. (Diagnosed 2026-06-07; the app role `iw_orch` is intentionally non-superuser.)

> ⚠️ **Same-disk limitation.** The default `IW_CORE_BACKUP_DIR=/opt/postgres/data/backups` is a *sibling* of `pgdata/` on the **same disk** as the data. It guards against the actual recurring failures — operator mistakes, bad migrations, and container displacement (the 2026-04-22 / 2026-05-29 / 2026-05-31 displacement incidents; `/opt/postgres/data` is a host bind mount, so `docker volume rm` / `compose down -v` cannot touch it) — but it does **NOT** protect against disk failure or `rm -rf /opt/postgres/data`. The path is configurable precisely so it can be repointed off-host (Tier-2 / I-00122 context). See [`docs/IW_AI_Core_DB_Backup_Restore.md`](docs/IW_AI_Core_DB_Backup_Restore.md).

Managed projects live in `projects.toml`; the daemon's `project_registry.py` syncs it to the DB on SIGHUP (`./ai-core.sh daemon reload`).

## Live DB Setup

**Port 5433** — pre-existing `postgres` Docker container (NOT docker-compose managed in production).

The default `docker-compose.yml` at the project root is **intentionally empty**. The `db` service lives in `docker-compose.bootstrap.yml` and is invoked only with `-f docker-compose.bootstrap.yml up -d db` — never implicitly. This prevents `docker compose up` from a worktree creating a rogue empty volume that clobbers the production DB (the 2026-04-22 data-loss incident).

See [`docs/IW_AI_Core_DB_Setup.md`](docs/IW_AI_Core_DB_Setup.md) for both setup paths.

**Never run `docker compose up` or `docker compose up -d db` in any form against the orchestration DB.** Always go through `./ai-core.sh db start`.

## Common Commands

```bash
./ai-core.sh install                                # uv sync + db start + migrate
./ai-core.sh start                                  # db → migrate → daemon → dashboard
./ai-core.sh status                                 # full status summary (inc. DB identity)
uv run iw --help                                    # CLI help
uv run iw db-identity check                         # verify DB instance fingerprint
make test-unit                                      # Fast tests (no containers)
make test-integration                               # Tests with PostgreSQL testcontainer
make lint                                           # ruff + node --check (dashboard JS) + scripts/check_templates.py (Jinja2)
make quality                                        # lint + format-check + mypy
make check                                          # quality + all tests
make db-migrate                                     # alembic upgrade head
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "MSG"     # Generate migration
```

## Playwright CLI (Browser Automation)

Headless WSL/Linux — use `playwright-cli` exclusively. Binary: `~/.local/bin/playwright-cli`. Config: `.playwright/cli.config.json`.

**ALWAYS** run `playwright-cli kill-all` before starting a new browser session.
**NEVER** call `chromium.launch()` directly, use `agent-browser`, or run install commands.

```bash
playwright-cli kill-all              # Kill all sessions first
playwright-cli open <url>            # Open URL in browser
playwright-cli snapshot              # Accessibility snapshot of current page
playwright-cli screenshot            # Saves to .playwright-cli/page-<ts>.png (no path arg!)
                                     #   cp .playwright-cli/page-*.png <target>  ← to name the file
                                     #   playwright-cli screenshot <path> is INVALID — treats path
                                     #   as a page element ref, not a file destination
playwright-cli click <selector>      # Click an element
playwright-cli fill <selector> <v>   # Fill a form field
playwright-cli -s=<name> open <url>  # Named session (for auth persistence)
```
