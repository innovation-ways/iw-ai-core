# CR-00084 S12 QV Fix Cycle 1/5

Quality gate S12 for work item CR-00084 failed. Fix the issues below so the gate passes on re-run.

## Scope (allowed_paths from workflow-manifest.json)

You MAY only modify files matching these globs:

  tests/llm_judge/**
  tests/unit/test_llm_judge_script.py
  scripts/llm_judge_test_review.py
  agents/claude/code-review-impl.md
  agents/opencode/code-review-impl.md
  .claude/agents/code-review-impl.md
  .opencode/agents/code-review-impl.md
  Makefile
  docs/IW_AI_Core_Testing_Strategy.md
  skills/iw-ai-core-testing/**
  .claude/skills/iw-ai-core-testing/**
  ai-dev/work/TESTS_ENHANCEMENT.md
  pyproject.toml
  uv.lock

Edits to files outside this list will block the cycle. If the failing gate
appears to require an out-of-scope edit, do NOT make it — instead document
the required out-of-scope path(s) under "blockers" in your result contract,
and the operator will amend allowed_paths.

## Design Doc — Source of Truth (READ FIRST)

The design document for this work item is the authoritative spec for the change. Read it before applying any fix:

- **Path**: `/home/sergiog/dev/iw-doc-plan/main/iw-ai-core/.worktrees/CR-00084/ai-dev/active/CR-00084/CR-00084_CR_Design.md`
- Why this matters: prior fix cycles on this codebase have failed because the agent trusted the failure-report's *root-cause hypothesis* and drifted away from the design doc's explicit fix spec. **The design doc wins when the two disagree.**

## Diagnostic Hypothesis — Errors to Address

The block below is **one hypothesis** generated from the failed gate. Verify it against the design doc spec above before applying any fix; the spec wins on conflict.

**Error**: assertions failed: exit=2

**Gate report**:

## Gate

| Field        | Value           |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Gate         | assertions      |
| Command      | `make test-assertions` |
| Exit code    | 2             |
| Result       | FAIL         |
| Duration (s) | 1       |

## Output (tail)

```
tests/unit/test_llm_judge_script.py:27: no-assert: test_accepts_well_formed: function body contains no assertions
tests/unit/test_llm_judge_script.py:387: tautology: test_token_spend_accumulated: every assert matches a tautological form (is not None / isinstance / len > 0)
make: *** [Makefile:70: test-assertions] Error 1
```

## Verdict

```
fail
```

```


## Gate Command

The quality gate that failed runs:
```bash
make test-assertions
```

After applying fixes, re-run this command to verify the issues are resolved.

## Pre-fix Procedure

1. **Read the design doc** at the path above. Skim the section that covers this step's scope; quote-of-the-doc lives in this prompt when available.
2. **Diff your target file(s) against the spec** — list deviations explicitly before editing.
3. **Apply the minimum patch** to align code with the spec; the reported errors should resolve as a side effect of that alignment.
4. **If the errors disagree with the spec, the spec wins.** Note the disagreement in your output rather than silently following the errors.

## Constraints

1. **Only fix the reported errors.** Do not refactor unrelated code.
2. **Preserve existing behavior.** Fixes must not break working functionality.
3. **Follow project conventions.** Read `CLAUDE.md` for patterns.
4. **Run the gate command after every fix** to verify resolution.


**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT call `iw step-done` or `iw step-fail`. Simply apply the fixes and exit. The orchestrator handles the rest.
