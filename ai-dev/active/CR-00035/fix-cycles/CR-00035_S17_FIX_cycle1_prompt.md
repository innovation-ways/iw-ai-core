# CR-00035 S17 QV Fix Cycle 1/5

Quality gate S17 for work item CR-00035 failed. Fix the issues below so the gate passes on re-run.

## Design Doc — Source of Truth (READ FIRST)

The design document for this work item is the authoritative spec for the change. Read it before applying any fix:

- **Path**: `/home/sergiog/dev/iw-doc-plan/main/iw-ai-core/.worktrees/CR-00035/ai-dev/active/CR-00035/CR-00035_CR_Design.md`
- Why this matters: prior fix cycles on this codebase have failed because the agent trusted the failure-report's *root-cause hypothesis* and drifted away from the design doc's explicit fix spec. **The design doc wins when the two disagree.**

## Diagnostic Hypothesis — Errors to Address

The block below is **one hypothesis** generated from the failed gate. Verify it against the design doc spec above before applying any fix; the spec wins on conflict.

**Error**: unit-tests failed: exit=2

**Unparseable output** (always surfaces):
  Failed CR-00035 step S17: unit-tests failed: exit=2


## Gate Command

The quality gate that failed runs:
```bash
make arch-check
```

After applying fixes, re-run this command to verify the issues are resolved.

## Pre-fix Procedure

1. **Read the design doc** at the path above. Skim the section that covers this step's scope; quote-of-the-doc lives in this prompt when available.
2. **Diff your target file(s) against the spec** — list deviations explicitly before editing.
3. **Apply the minimum patch** to align code with the spec; the reported errors should resolve as a side effect of that alignment.
4. **If the errors disagree with the spec, the spec wins.** Note the disagreement in your output rather than silently following the errors.

## Constraints

1. **Only fix the reported errors.** Do not refactor unrelated code.
2. **Preserve existing behavior.** Fixes must not break working functionality.
3. **Follow project conventions.** Read `CLAUDE.md` for patterns.
4. **Run the gate command after every fix** to verify resolution.


**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT call `iw step-done` or `iw step-fail`. Simply apply the fixes and exit. The orchestrator handles the rest.
