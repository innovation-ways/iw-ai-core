# CR-00036_S18_SelfAssess_prompt

**Work Item**: CR-00036 -- Batch-level auto_merge toggle with operator-approved manual merge
**Step**: S18
**Agent**: SelfAssess

## ⛔ Docker is off-limits

You MUST NOT execute ANY of the following commands or any command that
changes Docker container/volume/network state:

  docker kill | docker stop | docker rm | docker restart
  docker compose up | docker compose down | docker compose restart
  docker-compose up | docker-compose down | docker-compose restart
  docker volume rm | docker volume prune
  docker system prune | docker container prune | docker image prune

The orchestration database, daemon, dashboard, and any long-lived
infrastructure containers are outside your scope. Touching them can
cause multi-hour outages and data loss (see the 2026-04-22 incident in
docs/IW_AI_Core_DB_Setup.md).

Allowed exceptions:

  1. Testcontainers spun up by pytest fixtures (they self-label and
     self-destruct via Ryuk).
  2. Read-only introspection: `docker ps`, `docker inspect`, `docker logs`.
  3. Invoking `./ai-core.sh` or `make` targets — those know which
     commands are safe.

If your task seems to require a prohibited command, STOP and raise a
blocker. Do not work around this rule.

## ⛔ Migrations: agents generate, daemon applies

Your job is to ANALYZE the item's execution, not to modify the database.

Allowed for agents:
  - alembic history / current / show           (read-only)
  - Running migrations inside testcontainer fixtures
    (tests/conftest.py does this — agents don't call it directly)

If your task seems to require applying a migration to the live DB, STOP and raise a blocker.

## Input Files

- **Item ID** — `$IW_ITEM_ID` env var (set by the executor; this is the canonical source).
- **Worktree logs** — `.worktrees/CR-00036/ai-dev/logs/` — run logs, fix-cycle logs.
- **Item reports dir** — `ai-dev/work/CR-00036/reports/` — existing step reports (secondary evidence only).

## Output Files

- `ai-dev/work/CR-00036/reports/CR-00036_self_assess_report.md` — Human-readable narrative analysis.
- `ai-dev/work/CR-00036/reports/CR-00036_self_assess_findings.json` — Structured findings JSON.

## Context

You are running the self-assessment step for work item **CR-00036**.

This step invokes the `iw-item-analyze` skill to analyze the just-completed item's execution history and surface process improvement findings. This step is **soft** — failure does NOT block the item from merging. Produce the best report you can even if the analysis is partial.

**Use the `iw-item-analyze` skill** to perform the analysis. The skill is auto-discovered by both Claude Code (via `.claude/skills/iw-item-analyze/SKILL.md`) and OpenCode (which reads the same path). In Claude Code, invoke it via the `Skill` tool with `skill: "iw-item-analyze"`. In OpenCode, the skill is loaded by default for the agent and you can reference it by name in your reasoning. Do NOT re-implement the analysis procedure inline — the skill is the source of truth for the output contract (two files: `_self_assess_report.md` + `_self_assess_findings.json`).

## Soft-Step Semantics

This step's failure does NOT block merge — but produce a usable report anyway.
If the analysis can't complete, write a stub report explaining why and a
`findings: []` JSON.

## Subagent Result Contract

When your work is complete, report results in this JSON structure:
