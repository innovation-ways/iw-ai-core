# I-00062 S14 QV Fix Cycle 5/5

Quality gate S14 for work item I-00062 failed. Fix the issues below so the gate passes on re-run.

## Design Doc — Source of Truth (READ FIRST)

The design document for this work item is the authoritative spec for the change. Read it before applying any fix:

- **Path**: `/home/sergiog/dev/iw-doc-plan/main/iw-ai-core/.worktrees/I-00062/ai-dev/active/I-00062/I-00062_Issue_Design.md`
- Why this matters: prior fix cycles on this codebase have failed because the agent trusted the failure-report's *root-cause hypothesis* and drifted away from the design doc's explicit fix spec. **The design doc wins when the two disagree.**

## Diagnostic Hypothesis — Errors to Address

The block below is **one hypothesis** generated from the failed gate. Verify it against the design doc spec above before applying any fix; the spec wins on conflict.

**Error**: integration-tests failed: exit=2

**Command output**:
```
Failed I-00062 step S14: integration-tests failed: exit=2

```


## Gate Command

The quality gate that failed runs:
```bash
make test-integration
```

After applying fixes, re-run this command to verify the issues are resolved.

## Pre-fix Procedure

1. **Read the design doc** at the path above. Skim the section that covers this step's scope; quote-of-the-doc lives in this prompt when available.
2. **Diff your target file(s) against the spec** — list deviations explicitly before editing.
3. **Apply the minimum patch** to align code with the spec; the reported errors should resolve as a side effect of that alignment.
4. **If the errors disagree with the spec, the spec wins.** Note the disagreement in your output rather than silently following the errors.

## Constraints

1. **Only fix the reported errors.** Do not refactor unrelated code.
2. **Preserve existing behavior.** Fixes must not break working functionality.
3. **Follow project conventions.** Read `CLAUDE.md` for patterns.
4. **Run the gate command after every fix** to verify resolution.


**ESCALATION**: This is the FINAL fix cycle (5/5). **PREFER honest escalation over a Hail-Mary fix that drifts from the design spec.** If you cannot resolve every issue while staying aligned with the design doc, document which issues remain and why — the human reviewer can act on the evidence.

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT call `iw step-done` or `iw step-fail`. Simply apply the fixes and exit. The orchestrator handles the rest.
